        <br>
        <p style=color:black class="center">
          Formula One racing, the highest class of open wheeled racing has been around for 70 years.
          In that time thirty-three men from thirteen countries have been named drivers champion.
          Formula 1 also crowns the winningest contructor of the car's chassis at the end of the season.
          Constructors and drivers both come and go as their success waxes and wanes. Some have endured
          throughout the history of Formula 1 such as Ferrari and Alfa Romeo. Others were only around
          for a single season like the American Tec-Mec or the Italian Milano. Some like Mercedes come 
          and go from the sport over the decades. One thing has remained constant though: the presence
          and dominance of British drivers and constructors in Formula 1 racing.

        <br>
        <p style=color:black class="center">
          First we will take a look at the constructors that have won a championship since Formula 1's
          inception. There have been only 15 teams to have won in the sports 70 year history. When first
          looking at this plot what stands out is that Ferrari has had ALOT of success. The italian 
          outfit has been awarded a record sixteen titles. Almost twice as many as the next most successful
          team, Williams at nine. But Ferrari is the only Italian constructor to have ever one a
          championship. Ten of the fifteen victors have been British teams. France is the only
          other nation to have hosted more than one championship winning team.

        <h1 style=color:black class="center">Constructors Championships by Nation</h1>
        <br>
        <p style=color:black class="center">
          Showing the proportion of the constructors who have won a championship by nation clearly shows
          the disparity between British teams and everyone else. **%** of championships have been won by a 
          British outfit. In recent years Mercedes, a German manufacturer, has been hands-down the most 
          dominant team in the field. They are currently on track to win their seventh consecutive title
          by the end of the 2020 season. But Mercedes has a long way to go before Germany closes the gap
          with teams based in Britain.

        <p style=color:black class="center">
          Now we look at the rockstars of the racing world. What makes the results of the drivers unique
          when compared to those of the constructors is that there are often non-British drivers racing in
          British cars and visa-versa. Even still the Brits reign as the nation with the most succesful drivers.
          Currently Lewis Hamilton, six-time world champion, is currently in the hunt for the retired German \
          Michael Schumacher's record seven titles. The British driver is racking up more titles every year and 
          is not showing any signs of stopping.

        <br>
        <p style=color:black class="center">
          Again, looking at the proportion of championships sorted by the driver's country of origin reveals
          just how strong the British are in the sport. **%** of all drivers championships have been won
          by a British driver. Germany is at a distant second with **%**. And with Lewis Hamilton looking
          like he will continue to race for a few more seasons it's likely that the gap will only widen.
