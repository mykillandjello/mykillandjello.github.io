        <br>
        <p style=color:black class="center">
          Formula One racing, the highest class of open wheeled racing has been around for 70 years.
          In that time thirty-three men from thirteen countries have been named drivers champion.
          Formula 1 also crowns the winningest contructor of the car's chassis at the end of the season.
          Constructors and drivers both come and go as their success waxes and wanes. Some have endured
          throughout the history of Formula 1 such as Ferrari and Alfa Romeo. Others were only around
          for a single season like the American Tec-Mec or the Italian Milano. Some like Mercedes come 
          and go from the sport over the decades. One thing has remained constant though: the presence
          and dominance of British drivers and constructors in Formula 1 racing.

        <h1 style=color:black class="center">Constructors Championships</h1>
        <br>
        <p style=color:black class="center">
          First we will take a look at the constructors that have won a championship since Formula 1's
          inception. There have been only 15 teams to have won in the sports 70 year history. When first
          looking at this plot what stands out is that Ferrari has had ALOT of success. The italian 
          outfit has been awarded a record sixteen titles. Almost twice as many as the next most successful
          team, Williams at nine. But Ferrari is the only Italian constructor to have ever one a
          championship. Ten of the fifteen victors have been British teams. France is the only other 
          nation to have hosted more than one championship winning team.

        <br>
        <p style=color:black class="center">
          Showing the proportion of the constructors who have won a championship by nation clearly shows
          the disparity between British teams and everyone else. 2/3 championships have been won by a 
          British outfit.

          Now we look at the rockstars of the racing world. Currently Lewis Hamilton, six-time world
          champion, is currently in the hunt for the retired Michael Schumacher's record seven titles.

        <p style=color:black class="center">
          Again, looking at the proportion of championships sorted by the driver's country of origin reveals
          just how strong the British are in the sport.
